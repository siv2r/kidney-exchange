## General Guidelines
1. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/uH35zjW5cN), introduce yourself and get to know the people working on this project.
2. Be kind and respectful to the people involved since everyone contributes to this project in their free time.
3. Community members cannot answer your question right away (We are also college students like most of you 🤪) so, please be patient.
4. Do worry that there only 17 issues (Hence spamming all issue with **"Please assign this?"** 😵). All the problems with this project are not mentioned in the issues section so, this number will likely increase.
5. If you feel that none of the issue matches you interest, you can mention your ideas or any bugs you found while setting up this project by creating a new issue and start working on it.
6. It is not necessary that you need to be assigned to an issue to work on it. You can start working on it right away but let other members know by commenting on the issue. You can comment "I would like to work on this issue", "I would like to take a shot at this issue" insead of asking to be assigned.
7. Do not comment **"Please assign me this issue?"** in **all the issues pages**. This shows that you have not done any research to solve an issue and would not make a good impression with the mentors.
8. You are more likely to get a reply from the community members if your questions are related to this project. If have any questions related to the workings of Git/GitHub please google them there are ton of resources out there!!
9. If you run into any conflicts while rebasing your pull request, Feel free ask for help 🙂.
10. Please use a proper commit message. **Avoid commit messages like "some commit", "2nd commit", "updated branch", "commit"**.
11. Community members are not entitled to answer you since everyone contributes to this project in their free time so, please do your research (try to google your doubts) before asking any question.
12. **Avoid using "sir"** 😅 (We all are friends here!), you can just mention that person using '@'.
